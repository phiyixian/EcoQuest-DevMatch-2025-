    <p><strong>Shiitake Mushrooms in Malaysia:</strong><br>
While not naturally suited to tropical climates, shiitake mushrooms are increasingly cultivated in Malaysia through controlled indoor farming and in highland areas. The similar-looking "black fungus" (Auricularia spp.) is often confused with shiitake in local markets.</p>

<p><strong>Key Production Areas:</strong><br>
Cameron Highlands and other elevated regions feature shiitake cultivation facilities, where cooler temperatures and humidity control enable year-round growth.</p>

<p><strong>Market Note:</strong><br>
Malaysia's shiitake market relies heavily on imports, but local production is growing to meet demand for this nutritious, umami-rich mushroom in Asian cuisine and health products.</p>`,

The similar-looking Casuarina ("Rhu") tree is often mistaken for a true pine.</p> <p><strong>Key Locations:</strong><br> Fraserâ€™s Hill features pine-like scenery, with conifers grown above 1,400m elevation to create cool-climate landscapes.</p> <p><strong>Ecological Note:</strong><br> Malaysiaâ€™s tropical rainforests naturally lack true pines â€“ these are introduced species for tourism and aesthetics.</p>`,

  description: `<p><strong>Cows in Malaysia:</strong><br>
Malaysia's cattle industry relies heavily on imports, with local production meeting only 20% of beef demand and 6% of dairy needs. The country's tropical climate limits large-scale cattle farming, making feedlot systems and integration with oil palm plantations key strategies for production :cite[2]:cite[3].</p>

<p><strong>Key Breeds & Systems:</strong><br>
The indigenous Kedah-Kelantan cattle dominate local herds, while crossbreeding with imported breeds (e.g., Australian Brahman) improves meat yields. Most cattle are raised in smallholder farms (<10 heads), with intensive feedlots producing 6,000 to 7,000 heads annually :cite[3]:cite[6].</p>

<p><strong>Economic Note:</strong><br>
Cattle contributed ~RM** billion to GDP of Malaysia in 2024, with beef imports (mainly from India) priced 50% lower than local produce. The industry faces challenges from climate sensitivity and feed costs, but palm kernel cake (PKC) offers a sustainable feed alternative :cite[2]:cite[3]:cite[6].</p>`,
